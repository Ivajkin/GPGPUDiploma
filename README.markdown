The following presentation demonstrates amazing galaxy with beautiful shiny stars.
High-resolution computer simulations have become the indispensable tool to understand the nature of the Universe.

Galaxies are the collections of up to hundreds of billions of stars, lots of gas, and mysterious dark matter. They are quite closely distributed in the universe, and gravitationally attract one another. From observations we have long known that they routinely collide. These ubiquitous mergers of galaxies shape them, aid in the growth of supermassive black holes at their centers, trigger star formation, induce structural changes. Understanding these events is one of the toughest problems in for understanding galaxy formation in general. In fact, such a merger is what is going happen to our Milky Way galaxy in only about 6 billion years as it is already coming together with our nearest large neighboring galaxy, Andromeda, at a speed of more than 100 km/s.
